# PD-Controller-For-1D-Quadrotor
This project implements a Proportional-Derivative (PD) control system for a one-dimensional (1D) quadrotor. The objective is to stabilize the quadrotor's position along a single axis while counteracting disturbances and ensuring smooth motion.

The PD controller computes corrective actions based on the position error (difference between desired and current positions) and its rate of change, allowing for precise and responsive control. This project is ideal for understanding control theory concepts, experimenting with feedback mechanisms, and applying them in a simulated environment.
